# server-sleeper

basically i have a small raspberry pi that sips power, and a big computer that takes a lot of power. the raspberry pi is always on; i want to wake/sleep the big computer as-needed.

waker offers an api to put the computer to sleep, while rhythm determines whether the computer should be awake or asleep, based on various signals. there's some jank here and there, but this has been running pretty happily and saving me money for quite some time now.
